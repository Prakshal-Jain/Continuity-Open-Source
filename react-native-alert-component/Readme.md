## Why use react-native-alert-component?
Our research study on user experience found that small-screen devices, such as mobile phones, have a confusing layout that becomes even more uncomfortable when alert messages appear on top of an existing page. These alert messages are often not responsive on all screen sizes and types, which can hinder the user experience. For example, when a user enters an invalid email address while trying to log in, they may be repeatedly interrupted by error messages that obstruct the functionality of the app.

To address this issue, we have introduced in-line alert messages that are integrated with the app's layout. These messages can be dismissed by the user and do not interfere with the app's ongoing functionality. The purpose of these messages is to simply remind the user that they entered something incorrectly and provide a way to resolve it, without hindering their ability to use the app.

## Getting Started
- Install the component in your react native app:
```
npm install react-native-alert-component --save
```

- Import:
```
import AlertComponent from 'react-native-alert-component';
```

- Use:
```
<AlertComponent />
```

## Properties (Props)
- <b>stepCount</b> (Integer): This property indicates the total number of steps in the progress bar.

- <b>currStep</b> (Integer): This property specifies the current step of the progress bar that will be filled with color.

- <b>colorScheme</b> ('light' | 'dark'): This property sets the color scheme of the progressbar to either light or dark. To get the device's default color scheme, you can use the useColorScheme hook (https://reactnative.dev/docs/usecolorscheme).
